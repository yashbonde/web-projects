# web-projects

This is a consolidation of small projects and test scripts. This is more of a development series for the final goal that is my [website](yashbonde.github.io). There are many projects here that I will be updating and adding to my main website, such as in `/story` folder I am developing a interactive blog on Indian Railways.

Using my own stylesheets has really freed me up!
