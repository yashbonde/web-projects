        <h1>Second in the <em>Series</em> of Musings</h1>
        <h2>A step in another direction</h2>

        <p> 
            With my previous <a class="article-a" href = "https://medium.com/@yashbonde/first-in-the-series-of-musings-b547ad86865f">post</a> written well over 4 months ago from the date of this writing I talked about A.I. and it's types and then somehow jabbered into talking about a T-shaped person.
            Well since then I have written about variety of topics such as Transformer "Attention is all you need" network, built it up in python and tensorflow and discussed a bit about the code. Then wrote a couple of vague articles and in the end wrote about my latest project Freeciv Learning Environment.
            But with another bitter-sweet year coming to an end and I wanted something new and fresh, something to get me out of this boredom I have been feeling. And so I took up a long <em>(4 year old)</em> project and decided to code up my own website.

        <h3>BUILDING MY OWN WEBSITE</h3>
        <p>
            For the hosting and handling part I am currently relying on github pages while for the coding part I decided to start from sratch. Read a few blogs, watched a few videos and bam there it is a small <a class = "article-a" href="https://yashbonde.github.io/resume">resume</a> and then a <a class="article-a" href="https://yashbonde.github.io">landing page </a> in just a few hours.
            I always felt like having my own website will allow me to showcase my work in the best way possible and give me a wider skill set. Having interactive websites and using those along with the AI tools and models that I build in python is a really cool idea.
            <strong>And aren't all great things started as just really cool ideas.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I learned alot from <a class="article-a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq-Q7CDj6ZI">this</a> particular video and used this as the template to built my website. I think I will make my own style sheets and share them to make it easy for people to use those.
